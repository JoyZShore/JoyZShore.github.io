00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.100 
Debbie angelcc we work

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.900 
with lgbtq on business is

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.800 
not just here in the United States but Italy said we're celebrating tried all over the world

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
and well unfortunately we were sore

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.900 
start spending pride inside this year

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.000 
and actually meant that we were closer than ever to our siblings around the world

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800 
because we remove physical

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.800 
barriers and opened up a new virtual

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.600 
Pathways to learning to sharing it

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.200 
experiences so as we were living through this new paradigm we were

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.800 
matching lgbt-owned video production companies

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.900 
with graphic designers with swag printers

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
with all of them in person event

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.200 
and created the spoon

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000 
Paradigm of digital virtual

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.100 
lgbtq

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.200 
celebration has so many of them on

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.700 
the arm Pride Sunday

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.100 
to help reach particularly those with different abilities and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.400 
lgbtq youth who don't always have the same sort of access that maybe some of us in the big cities do so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.200 
it was a unique Pride for

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.300 
sure but really special one for the way

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.600 
for learning how to celebrate and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.100 
connect in the New World

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.200 
how did Lions bring Lucifer and Multicultural marketing aim was founded three years ago

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.000 
and we have been focusing on

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.600 
lifting the barriers that exist

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.700 
between marketers

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.500 
and Motorcoach on inclusive consumers

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.300 
during that the marketing

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.000 
evolve and delivers better results for both consumers

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.600 
and for marketers so we were putting diverse cast

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.100 
in whitewash situations

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.400 
and that's where the market

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.200 
thought was the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.400 
threshold for bringing all consumers and inspiring them together behind the intent of a brand

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.200 
and what we discovered was that

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.800 
obviously diversity

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.600 
is rewarded

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.500 
but what really goes to the maximum level of cultural relevancy

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.500 
is when consumers

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.600 
feel that the word depicted

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.600 
in the richness

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.900 
in the authentic and genuine richness of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.700 
their truth the true colors

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.300 
and when that happens

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.900 
the magic for the brand really starts

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.900 
so it's not it's not at marginal left

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.000 
it sit

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.300 
Stripling the potential

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.600 
outcome of

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.100 
sales for brand

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.100 
I think as a business is okay to say we want some

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.400 
short wins or quick

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.700 
wins but we're committed to this being a part of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000 
you going to eat those of our organizations for years and decades to come like there's nothing wrong with saying that we were going to figure out what that looks like but that is our true commitment

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.100 
and is starting there is a really important.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:37.600 
stop because we understand how long it can take sometimes when we're literally talking about shifting systemic multi-generational

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.500 
traumas and problems and disparities that I have happened it's not going to be solved by Friday right and it's not going to be

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.800 
solved may not even be solved in our lifetime but I do want to see a commitment

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:59.100 
that every single year year-over-year the resources the dollars the conversation the activity is is fully ingrained into

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.700 
I'm the business models the business plans to keep you eyes because what we find is what we measure right

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.600 
and what that looks like in totality across all sectors all

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.300 
Industries all departments within a company

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.900 
how does it spell out until your community

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.200 
I'm in your activity and how you show up there

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.300 
all of those things are a really important and so

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.200 
that is that is where it where it starts and I think once we start having more of those really honest conversation

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.500 
but that end and then those commitments

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.900 
I'm bringing as many people to the table in order for that to be lived out in actual sizes and then the next

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.400 
the natural Next Step

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.100 
a lot of it for me is just been a

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.200 
community building

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.300 
and one of the things that we tried to that I was riveted last year

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.100 
to try to figure out what to do and I literally

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.000 
calling as many people as I could nonprofit look in the marketing and advertising space advertisers marketers

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.400 
and I think you do bring people together write it at that may have not been brought together before so

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.500 
you know one of the communities that we have brought together where the marketing

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.300 
community and you're and you're like well

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.900 
when I brought like 25 marketers together all Chief marketing officer is all of them Asian

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.500 
American people like what like

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.600 
I got all five of us right like there's there's like nobody

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.700 
but it turned out there's like a lot of folks is. Just 25

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.800 
and like when you bring 25 marketers together from different kinds of companies typically will say like

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.300 
not everybody's going to agree what to do

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.400 
but what everybody agreed to it just they

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.300 
likes being together and the word that has evolved from Community with this word Fellowship
