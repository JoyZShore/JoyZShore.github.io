<v 0>Hi everybody. I'm Barb Palin.</v>

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.620
I oversee the talent and inclusion strategy for Comcast advertising,

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.500
which means I spend most of my time thinking about you.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.610
Thinking about you and your career and where you're going and where.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.610
<v 1>We can tap into your expertise. So I'm.</v>

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.010
<v 0>Thrilled you're here. Every new hire.</v>

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.940
<v 1>We bring into the organization has an opportunity to reach their potential.</v>

8
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.370
<v 0>And part of my role is to help you do that.</v>

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.490
It's been a few years since I've had my first day,

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.750
but I remember feeling overwhelmed, uh, excited,

11
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.350
energized, and kind of that healthy butterfly thing.

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.340
So I'm hoping you have that. And honestly, I hope you have it every day,

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.390
even a little bit. If you can approach every day at Comcast,

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.400
slightly like a new hire with fresh eyes and fresh perspective and open to

15
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:55.760
ideas and open to meeting new people, that's brilliant.

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.620
It's a great way to run your career.

17
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.850
As you evolve from the first few days of working here and kind of learning the

18
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:04.580
ropes of everything, you're going to find a ton.

19
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.800
<v 1>Of resources. You might not tap.</v>

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.770
<v 0>Into them all at once. That's okay, hold on to them.</v>

21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.760
But you'll learn about activities like our cultural series,

22
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.310
our ERG employee resource groups,

23
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
our community outreach through Comcast cares.

24
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.930
You learn our development organization, your HR department,

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.520
your government affairs.

26
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.450
There's so many things to learn and to grow and to stretch.

27
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.110
And that's just managing your career and managing your life.

28
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.590
I know that it's a lot of information to absorb.

29
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.950
You're getting to know your team and your boss and the organization,

30
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.340
and then this big organization that we have across the globe.

31
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.230
So there's a lot to soak in. I'd invite you just to be open to new ideas,

32
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.170
ask the hard questions. Don't be afraid to say,

33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.620
"Have we ever considered doing it this way?" Or, "Hey,

34
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:59.030
I have an idea." Or, "Wait a minute. This doesn't seem to make sense to me.

35
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:03.590
Can you help me explain it?" We welcome that. That's part of our culture.

36
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.050
When our company was founded under Roth Roberts,

37
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.370
it was founded with that entrepreneurial spirit that said we could do something

38
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:15.260
really good. If we did it together with respect and inclusion and engagement.

39
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.520
Don't be a stranger. Please reach out to me, let me know how you're doing,

40
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:22.850
how you're progressing and how I can help. Have a great first day.
