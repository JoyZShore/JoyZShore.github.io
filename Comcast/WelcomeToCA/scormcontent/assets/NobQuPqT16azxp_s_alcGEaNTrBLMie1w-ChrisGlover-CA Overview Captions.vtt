00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.100 
hi my name is Chris Glover and I wanted to give you an overview of Comcast

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.200 
advertising this presentation is meant to be more of a high-level look at

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.300 
the Comcast advertising organization as a whole going to take a quick look at effective as well as free will

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400 
Comcast advertising Group which is led by Marcien

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.200 
and really has two core components and that's effectv and that's

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.800 
Freewheel the simplest way to think about this

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.800 
is that effectv is the media

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.600 
advertising sales

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.200 
Comcast Freewheel to technology

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.700 
platform that's focused on connecting buyers and sellers through our

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.400 
technology to give you a brief overview of the high-level look at what we do

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.900 
let's start with effectv

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.300 
texting is really all about combining the targeting and measurement of digital with the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100 
reach and impact of TV their focus on delivering results that matter most

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.700 
to their clients

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.500 
and their focus on doing it right now

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.400 
we got a fact it is the media sales organization of Comcast that heavily leveraged is that local inventory across the Comcast footprint

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.200 
to sell unique Solutions across the digital and linear foot

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.300 
print solutions are really built around four key pillars

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.100 
find Target for court and

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.100 
prove that may sound simple as a contract

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.200 
but it's really hard work that the effective team does

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.800 
to make sure that they're delivering the most value for their car

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.400 
the finding audiences no matter where they're watching across different screen be a digital are linear

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.000 
able to precisely Target the core audience is that the advertisers are hoping to be

reporting back to the clients they can understand how their dollars were spent ultimately able

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.700 
through attribution to prove out

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.300 
that the dollars worth

makes you sure that customers are understanding what they're buying across screen

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.100 
and it's really the system

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.700 
don't have that effected needs to go out and acquire additional inventory

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.000 
groups to sell to their class

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.200 
and give them the technology to do that so that they can best acquire new inventory

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.200

effective inventory being available directly in the strata platform

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.200 
another way of showing that we're working together

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.700
