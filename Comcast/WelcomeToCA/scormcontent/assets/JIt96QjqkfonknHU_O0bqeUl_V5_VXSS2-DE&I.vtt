00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.500 
Welcome to our special edition of the day

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.000 
for Comcast advertising

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.700 
it's going to be a truly one-of-a-kind experience where we have our own vows ends of employees

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.800 
Around the Globe coming together at the same time and in some cases on tape delay

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.100 
add to foster a better understanding of diversity

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.700 
equality and inclusion

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.600 
and the actions that we can take both big and small as a company and personally

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
to create a more inclusive work space

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.500 
where everyone feels valued respected and supported

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.400 
one for me just to lay out the reason they were doing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.400 
there's two insects

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.000 
the first is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.800 
diversity of thought

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.100 
experience and background is good

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.600 
and it makes us better

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.700 
and the only way that we could see that is by creating an environment

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.500 
where everybody feels safe

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
respected and valued

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100 
so that's also important big reason that we're doing

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.000 
and finally I want to see up front and we don't have all the answers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.900 
but it's so it's really important for all of us to reflect on today both what we've seen and what we're about to see

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.500 
and think about what we individually can do

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.300 
differently

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.100 
ourselves

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.400 
and also how we can contribute

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.500 
to our overall

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.800 
and our overall company to see what we can do better

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.500 
mercy and said I wanted Greg wanted to create an environment where people want to stay in bro

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.800 
Kalahari manager

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.200 
and looking at Talent bringing them in

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.300 
and then observing them look around the people that look like them or a mentor in traffic headed

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.400 
and getting the reaction when they

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.400 
don't see that the way

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.000 
that the anticipated

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.800 
and then kind of wonder about trying to look

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.600 
for a resources either and other departments

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900 
in other parts of the company it stopped

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000 
taking my time and seeing how the company showed out

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.600 
and the resources they put behind it

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.600 
this great panel

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900 
above the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
the board that I am on for Effective and

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.000 
the relationships are developing their and Willie

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.600 
the listing is happening at a very high low

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.200 
it's been very

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.500 
humbling and I appreciate it

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.100 
it's so then allows me to open up and unpack things not going to do it here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.600 
and so it's just

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.400 
really kind of seeing beyond beyond yourself

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.200 
and your personal experience

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.500 
in and realizing that there's so much at stake

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.100 
right now and the importance of saying something
