<v 0>Hi everybody.</v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.900
My name is Marcien Jenckes and I'm the president of Comcast Advertising,

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.980
which basically means that my job is to make your job easier.

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.570
Welcome to the team. We are thrilled to have you here. Uh,

5
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:20.300
Comcast Advertising is a very special place.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.950
We're part of this entrepreneurial company that is singularly

7
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:26.060
focused on growth.

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.190
And the way that we grow is we solve problems and create solutions for our

9
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:34.010
customers. If they grow, we grow.

10
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.120
We're also part of the biggest media company in the world.

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.770
We're a global leader in technology and advertising. At Effectv,

12
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.120
at FreeWheel,

13
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:48.500
and across the other teams at Comcast Advertising that go between them.

14
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.490
We are transforming television in all of its formats,

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.340
into the world's most effective marketing platform.

16
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.380
We're doing amazing things every day,

17
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.780
things that have never been done anywhere else.

18
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.470
And we're doing that across the globe. Our employees,

19
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.510
you are at the center of all of that. The best solutions come from you.

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.540
And we appreciate you for the unique value that you bring.

21
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.870
That's why we build an inclusive, innovative,

22
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:17.810
and creative environment where everyone can succeed.

23
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.850
We're proud to be part of Comcast,

24
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.690
which was voted one of Fortune's best companies to work for in 2021.

25
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.720
My advice for you in the coming weeks is number one,

26
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.950
soak up all the information around you. Number two,

27
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.960
ask tough questions and number three, take risks.

28
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.690
Don't be afraid to fail. We've got you.

29
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.910
Comcast Advertising is truly redefining the future of TV advertising.

30
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.210
We can't wait for you to get started. Welcome.
