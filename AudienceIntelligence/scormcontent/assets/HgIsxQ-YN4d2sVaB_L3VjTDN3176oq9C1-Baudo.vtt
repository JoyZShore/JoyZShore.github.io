it's been a process it takes trust

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.400 
building because the way we sold schedules before is

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.700 
not the same we have a new tool we have new

data that allows us to do that we've had a couple of recent examples where clients have

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.500 
jump in the water with us they've tried it and said giving us an opportunity to say let's see how this works for two or three months and let's see if the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.400 
our traditional way of building schedule so we're starting to build a success stories

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.800 
la18 you have success they share with their team and then others looked at that same success with their clients
