TV is still the absolute greatest way to reach a wide audience there's no doubt about it effective cannot happen to the insides of our viewership data

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.100 
to be able to find the correct audience

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.900 
out of the masses that we reached we're looking really provide that improved

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.500 
experience both for our a he's as well as for a client

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.400 
but to help them grow their businesses and maintain competitive

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.000 
advantage

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:43.700 
specific group of clients that are using all these colors for local are more likely to stick with us by number one Advertiser pretty much every schedule we built for them was based on

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
a i l behind it is to find the audience

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.700 
build a schedule which will then give the account exact more time on the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.300 
streets delivered more we owe them

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900 
do you need number of potential clients were you able to read

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.200 
using audit intelligence for local

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:12.400 
with a car dealership that we have locally and it was with their agency so I pulled the schedule using our lift

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.200 
to all and I sent it to him and he was getting

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.300 
twice the amount of his you know give me everything schedule

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.400 
but actually paying REITs that will

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.700 
clear is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.200 
what I like to call Quality Impressions

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.800 
and that means that

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.400 
it's backed by data that is at a large-scale this is a tremendously powerful

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.200 
tool and it's just the first base

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
only going to continue to get better
