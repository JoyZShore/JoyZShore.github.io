00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.600 
for me I'm just looking forward to

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.400 
having more time management

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.000 
with AI 2.0 the strategy behind it is to find the audience

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.200 
build a schedule which will then give the account exact more time on the streets if we're able to do so with a i 2.0

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.500 
I want to make sure that with this

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:33.700 
provisioner upgrade or update that I'm able to look at these networks and it actually matches the audience that's intended for that particular service or products or the message and more time management

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.600 
so my job is to make sure that their campaign

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.100 
is impactful and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.700 
it's effective
