00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:12.200 
hi Kelly Peron head of product for Effective I'm here today to tell you about all the new enhancements that we've been working on the ad audience intelligence for local 2. Oh

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:23.500 
we're so excited for these improvements we know they'll be better for you for your clients and we can't wait to tell you more about it let's chicken

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.200 
why would we change the order methodology It's really because we listen to our ABCs

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:41.400 
they told us that they wanted to see better results in terms of viewership reach and frequency

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.100 
the occurrence of a single spot for Network per week

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.500 
they wanted to save it at a time by automatically assigning budgets and zones according to the volume of households in those own

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.300 
when they were ordering a crock more than one zone

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.700 
they wanted more schedule variability between audience segments

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.800 
there are some things that aren't changing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.400 
the system is still going to choose from the network and a perk combinations

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.700 
that have a high index for the audience segments

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.100 
knows that we are watching

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.500 
this is the will only Tuesdays networks and a parks that have 10% of Nielsen household impressions

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.300 
for the demo that you selected in those sounds

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.400 
that way we're choosing Fusion

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.000 
original demo that's been selected

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.900 
and if it's only the network and a part combinations that have inventory available

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.000 
but at your data driven and inform schedule will clear

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.500 
in the commercials will Air

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.400 
but we have included in the new methodology

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.100 
the percentage of budget is allocated to his own according to the volume of households

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.400 
in those owned by the phone

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.700 
I mean to be spending more and more than less than smaller ones

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.800 
and you no longer have to do the math by yourself

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.700 
what classified the inventory the matches the audience segment into two groups based on our set-top box Tina

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.500 
more on that in a minute

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.200 
I'm finally the lift to order is high quality

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.200 
reaching the audience that matters

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.300 
unique and will rarely have a single spot per Network purses code per week

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.600 
let's talk through the changes into town

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.500 
go for a multi-zone campaign

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.300 
by default

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.900 
the campaign budget will be allocated to each their own proportionally based on their share of the household

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.300 
using this multi-zone campaign in the San Francisco dma is an example

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.400 
of the total budget

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.900 
corresponding to a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.200 
share of total household

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.000 
or 42%

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.100 
in that zone

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.500 
similarly the remaining budget is assigned to the rest of the zones based on their share of home

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.600 
the next change that we've made

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900 
in the methodology is how

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200 
we create the order

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.800 
and step one

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.700 
we still to be available inventory to the network and a part combinations persis code

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.800 
and meet the set-top box injecting criteria

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.600 
of 90 or a hundred in a bus

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.900 
step 2

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.000 
we remove any networks or day parks that have a projected impression value of zero

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.900 
or dental Impressions that are less than 10% of the house

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.200 
step 3 we've introduced

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.800 
something new

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.100 
here we're organizing the network and a part combinations that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.700 
that match the filters that have been applied in the two groups

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.300 
the first group will be 50% of the inventory

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.600 
with the highest Eggman penetration

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.300 
those are the parts that have the highest pair of audience households

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.400 
out of the entire list of networks and a party

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400 
that were both above 90 and 100

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.500 
and had Milton Impressions that met that criteria

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.200 
the second group will be 50% of the inventory and will be those networks and a parts that remain

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.200 
ranked by their

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.300 
highest to lowest efficiency index

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.100 
example is there a step 1 into

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.500 
the 10 that have the highest share of audience household

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.500 
or contraction

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.300 
will be assigned

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.400 
and the remaining time will be assigned a group to

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.500 
ranks by their highest to lowest index score

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.200 
step 3 was all about how we stagnant the inventory

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.900 
in this new methodology

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.100 
within it

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.700 
we do that budget allocation broadcast week level

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.600 
stolen stuff for we take 70% of the clients

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.900 
budget and split it equally between group one and two within each this

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.500 
code and broadcast week

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.500 
the tool will select from both groups

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.400 
provide a balance of reach to the audience and frequency

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.200 
based on our analysis

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.000 
in step 5

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:51.400 
will take the remaining 30% of that place budget and split it equally between Group 1 and 2 within it's just going to broadcast week

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.300 
in order to randomly selects box with his chores

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.400 
and no two orders will be exactly alike

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.600 
finally we know that our clients to have a wide range of budgets in the system does not treat all budgets the same

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.000 
the table in this fight outlines house spots are selected between both Group 1 and group 2

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.000 
based on different budget ranges

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.500 
sister always going to be more spot selected from group to for a given campaign

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.000 
because of the greater cost efficiency

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.900 
let's take a look at some results of the orders that we analyzed

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.300 
built using this new methodology

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.300 
as you can see

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.900 
our spot count has increased dramatically

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.000 
delivering more impressions

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.000 
the distinct volume of networks is similar

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.600 
although we have changed how we feel like them

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.000 
those differences will only show up when you really inspect at the Disco Dan broadcast beat level

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.600 
are in the feet are similar

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.600 
but just shows you that our intelligence for local

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.500 
already had a quite efficient algorithm it for reaching not strategic audience

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.100 
the order itself has far fewer line

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.200 
RC Tim is lower on average

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.800 
which makes sense if the spots increased and the budgets were comparable

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.400 
but the number of spots per Network more than doubled

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.100 
as you can see there's a large difference between what we did before

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.100 
and what we do now

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:57.600 
let's look briefly at two specific Market examples to highlight hair

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.000 
in this example in Atlanta

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.400 
for a $2,000 order spanning five weeks across to Cisco's

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.000 
you'll see that there are distinct networks at the V code and broadcast week level

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.800 
on average in the new methodology

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.900 
however what that does

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.300 
is increases the focus of the campaign because we have more spots on those

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.100 
networks per week than we would have before

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.400 
in some situations

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.300 
we have seen at the schedule generated using the new methodology might have more distinct that works over all of the campaign level

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.500 
but in general this gives you a sense of the differences in the number of lines and the schedule

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.900 
and the average number of spots per Network that we see between the two versions of audience intelligence for local

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.500 
Elizabeth 1 Philadelphia

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.800 
still see that the size of your order was reduced drastically

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.300 
the volume of the Spas

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.900 
her distinct Network increase

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.100 
thank you for your time getting a better understanding of the methodology

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.900 
an audit intelligence for local to. Go

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.800 
we're so excited to bring it to you and I just like to say thank you to everyone who was involved in making this possible

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.200 
from the eighties in the field to the elephant's in the sales leaders that we spoke with

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.200 
your partners and d i and I

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000 
and II the engineer's who without

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.900 
you we wouldn't have made it possible

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.700 
I really appreciate all of the efforts that God is here

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000 
you can't wait for you to see the results of this Improvement

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.800 
and share it with your client
