00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.400 
it's our first attempt to empower our local eighties to create data-driven campaigns

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.900 
in a very easy way

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.000 
and we found some great success with our first launch

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.100 
and we also heard a lot of feedback from people in the market about how we could do it better

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.200 
so the teams went back to the drawing board

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.500 
kept the really great parts of audience intelligence for local

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.400 
and improved upon the areas where we knew we could do better and we're excited to relaunch

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:36.300 
as 2.0 audience intelligence for local this spring the advertisers who were excited about it's all really really great results

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.900 
the challenges that we recovered were found directly by our sellers in the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.700 
field and we're grateful for all the feedback that they provide

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.800 
it because that help us figure out what we needed to do

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.600 
to make it even better we're looking to really provide that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000 
improved experience both furare he's as well as for a client
