00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.100 
I was just demonstrating as a company that we're listening to feedback

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900 
I think the two. O version

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.900 
addresses like the major

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:21.200 
pieces of feedback that most of our sales teams from around the country were providing but I know they're addressing things like their length of the contract being too long having to explain only one spot on one network over the course of a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.600 
4 week flight. Or something like that so the clients that are using on East houses for local are more likely

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.700 
to stick with us we're also seeing just an increase in Advertiser adoption a special

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
so it's really good to see that our advertisers are believing that this is the right way to reach the audience in matters to them and in the long run when we unify all of our Impressions and audiences across platform and this

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.300 
becomes even more eloquent than it is today

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.800 
will be ready
