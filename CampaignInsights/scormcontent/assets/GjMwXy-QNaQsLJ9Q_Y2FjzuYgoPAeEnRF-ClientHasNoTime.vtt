having this connection to discuss gaining access to your Google Analytics

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.900 
I really don't feel comfortable with anyone having

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.000 
access to my Google analytics that it makes me really nervous because

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.600 
Google already has access to my website data and I don't want anyone else to have access to it

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.000 
yeah I mean so honestly once we get access to it that's really the only or requesting read-only access

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.100 
so we're just looking at read and analyze only so it's nothing that we could ever

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.600 
know Eddie

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.000 
interesting so you won't be able to change anything

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.800 
honestly we cannot make any changes at all even if you want to take another step you can restrict what we see

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.900 
but no honestly all we do is just

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.000 
read analyze and interpret the data back to you

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.300 
okay alright

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.200 
I think I'll feel comfortable then doing that

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:13.400 
you can even whatever reason the partnership is no longer working out with us and you can even revoke are read-only access at any moment I'm honestly you're going to see the benefits of this is going to be no reason to do that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.100 
we need to take a deeper dive into your your campaign to show you know how this is working for you so you can really see the benefits of what this is doing

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.200 
okay show me before

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600 
yes cordially will be sitting on the go over

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.900 
reports and I'll show you exactly where your traffic is coming in and how it's coming

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.700 
in

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.300 
that's a deal alright sounds good thank you Tim
