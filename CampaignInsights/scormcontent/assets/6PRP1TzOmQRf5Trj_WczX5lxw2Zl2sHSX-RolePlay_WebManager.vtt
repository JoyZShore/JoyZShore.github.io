00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.800 
thank you for taking the time to meet with me again I'm again to refresh your memory the reason why

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.500 
I'm we're speaking again today

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.100 
it's cuz it's very important for us to get the Google

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.200 
analytics read-only access to your account

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.800 
again refresh your memory will be using that read-only access

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.900 
NordicTrack you campaigns performance to help prove attribution of the campaign back to you

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.000 
okay interesting so I actually have a web guy that manages by Google Analytics

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.900 
I don't know if I feel comfortable giving you that read-only access since I have him already doing reports for me

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.100 
all the time

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.400 
cheer up guy so that I can reach out to them personally

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.700 
I mean honestly it's not conflicting between us to I mean we would be supplementing each other and he would just need to be granting us the access was not really

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.800 
anything that would compromise anything that he's doing on your website and honestly

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.200 
a nice word of your back end note agency or web manager this is not a type of analysis that they can do on their own

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000 
so what we're going to do is again refresh your memory

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:26.500 
we want to take a deeper dive into his analytics to pull out key geographical insights in the zones that we are airing your campaign

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.300 
in again your Zone refresh your memory is our proprietary

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.600 
a geographical area under Soul County

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.200 
and we can help boil down all that data

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.800 
and it helped create an Easy-to-Read

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
case study and pull up those key metrics

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.700 
you're from the exact area that we're running your campaign in

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.800 
the date of back to you from exactly is running

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.700
