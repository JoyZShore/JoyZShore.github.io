00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.200 
there's a couple of major things that I will always tell my clients it's

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.800 
a weiner that video Drive search right that means is

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.900 
job search either want people to type in

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.500 
your your L your website directly

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.300 
or type in the name of your company or business and it enter into Google Chrome whatever web browser using

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.900 
the two forms of traffic reckon organic Drive

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200 
direct is when they taking your website directly

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.600 
in your name hitting enter into the search bar and whatever browser they're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400 
using and then clicking on your link when it shows up in

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.000 
probably Google cut to see what everybody's using

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.500 
so we know that video drives that right

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.600 
can we take a dive into your Google analytics we can see the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.200 
list in those main two areas of traffic

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.600 
we can then take a deeper dive in there and show you the exact geographical areas

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.600 
at the traffic is coming in from

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.900 
tight with or zones to show you hey

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.200 
you're airing in this Zone this is where your traffic is coming in from

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.800 
dusk proven the attribution

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.100 
because then take additional steps

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.100 
if you have Google goal set up

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.900 
mellow goal is pretty much

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.000 
easier if I can explain it is what is someone doing once they get to your website

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.100 
if you're a college or university or going to your admissions page

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.100 
but they going to directions

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.700 
anything of that nature

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.800 
we can take a deeper dive and see what someone would a user is doing once they get to your website
