00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.400 
an impact campaign insights there's three different

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.700 
colors the first pillar is case

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.200 
studies this will allow us to get that read-only

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.800 
access of me for my

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.100 
clients to be able to look at their website metrics

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.700 
this is where we can show them non auto-pay Sonny's Auto case studies and case studies and unprecedented times

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500 
a second pillar is historical analysis

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.900 
this is really important because once you get that read-only access

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.200 
you can go back into the client's data and see

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.000 
where they were advertising

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800 
and what zones to be able to build them a more strategic plan

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400 
our last pillar is campaign performance before

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.600 
this is a funnel that is a set of eyes report that shows a client's web traffic over to comparable

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.900 
time. There must be some sort of campaign

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
shift if that's a creative change or a strategy change

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.200 
something along those lines

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.800 
with our case studies we have Auto

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.400 
which we have creative change new Advertiser

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400 
canceled broadcast at a digital

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.500 
we also have our non-auto category which consists

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.600 
education Furniture Retail

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.100 
Finance excetera and we also

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.200 
showcase what a creative change looks like in those

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.800 
specific categories

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.400 
and then our newest category is unprecedented times with the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700 
recent Lifetime events we were able to show clients who were consistently advertising with us

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.900 
during this time we also showed clients who have a strong e-commerce and were

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.400 
able to continue that build

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.200 
with this

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.700 
specific time.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.800 
so now I'm going to walk you through an example of how you would use

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.400 
how you would position

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.900 
this type of

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.500 
case study if you have a home improvement

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.600 
client this is a chance for you to show them

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.600 
why granting you read-only access is so important

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.000 
we can show them what their website traffic looks like in the zones are advertising in

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.000 
so for instance in this case study we saw that and create a messaging to to emphasize safety

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.300 
show that total website sessions

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.100 
increased as well as total new users

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.900 
and Drakken organic traffic

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.400 
not only did the awareness and consideration increase

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.100 
but the intent the request and scheduled Services increased because people

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.900 
felt like they were being safe that the company was being safe

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.900 
and this is how we can proceed forward

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000 
after you show them the case study and they Grant you read only access

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100 
this is when you can use a historical analysis

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.900 
report so this is Oracle analysis report

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.000 
shows the client

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500 
of the Comcast owns this is where your

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.400 
sessions your new users and your goal completions are coming from

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.200 
the more heated orange is the more

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.000 
dense areas where has the letter r in Israel last track

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.300 
it's coming from this will let you build a consultative

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.200 
approach with your Advertiser so that way you guys

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.200 
can make a specific plan to make sure you're advertising in the right

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.200 
if you're not going to historical analysis route our third pillar is our campaign performance report

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.000 
so with our campaign performance report we start off by saying

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.000 
these are the three zones are advertising

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.800 
in now think of it this way

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.400 
if the historical analysis told you it's talk three

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.300 
zones are you decided to advertise in those top three

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.600 
zones thus resulting in a campaign

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.600 
performance report after 3 months of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.200 
airing your campaign with us

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.000 
so I'm left it shows you your prior. Your current.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.900 
Then we have our campaign details so we have the three zones that you're advertising in in the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.900 
strategy for in this instance this client changed creative

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.300 
next we move forward to what we call a the results

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.600 
this lets us see what the metrics

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.600 
look like across the three zones are advertising

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.000 
in so let's let you see of the three zones advertising

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.800 
advertising what were those sessions

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.100 
what were those new users

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.600 
and what was the most

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.500 
direct inorganic sessions happening and what

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.500 
zones so this is a nice overlay

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.000 
page for science to see

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.600 
what their Zones look like during their

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.100 
advertising campaign

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.300 
lastly we bring the client to our final page so we could prove that TV is a full Final Solution

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.100 
so first we look at the awareness

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.400 
total sessions and new

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.200 
user a session is someone who spends at least 5 seconds on the website

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.600 
a new user if someone has ever been to the website before

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.400 
in this example

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.200 
that both awareness that checks are at

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.500 
then we move down to the consideration

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.300 
phase so this is someone who is

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.800 
typing into Google

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.400 
your website URL

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.400 
or Googling your name

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.200 
we take credit for both of that

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.000 
we do not look at paid search

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.900 
in this example Dragon organic sessions is slightly down at

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.200 
26% but we move forward to the intent

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.500 
metrics so remember this client changed its creative

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.100 
so more goals were completed after they change their creative during

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.500 
this time so they had a total goal completions of 570 with a

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.000 
8% increase

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.300 
and this is how you would tell our

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.900 
impact story
